  .SYNOPSIS
  Configure WinRM over HTTPS inside an Azure VM.
  .DESCRIPTION
  1. Creates a self signed certificate on the Azure VM.
  2. Creates and executes a custom script extension to enable Win RM over HTTPS and opens 5986 in the Windows Firewall
  3. Creates a Network Security Rules for the Network Security Group attached the the first NIC attached the the VM allowing inbound traffic on port 5986
  .EXAMPLE
   Configure-AzureWinRMHTTPS -ResourceGroupName ""TestGroup"" -VMName ""TestVM""
  .EXAMPLE
  Give another example of how to use it
  .PARAMETER ResourceGroupName
  Name of the resource group that the VM exists in
  .PARAMETER VMName
  The name of the virtual machine you wish to enable Win RM on.
   .PARAMETER DNSName
  DNS name you will use to connect to the VM. If not provided defaults to the computer name.
  .PARAMETER SourceAddressPrefix
  Provide an CIDR value to restrict connections to a specific IP range
